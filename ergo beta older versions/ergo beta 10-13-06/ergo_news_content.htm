  <b>PERFORMANCE</b><br>

Legendary classical guitarist John Williams (playing a Greg Smallman guitar) 
and virtuoso jazz guitarist John Etheridge (playing the new Fox <b>ergo</b>) have 
teamed up to record and tour as a steel string - nylon string duo, featuring new 
material showcasing the two distinct and complementary voices of these 
instruments.  Their first concert was also the <b>ergo</b>'s European debut at
London's popular Pizza Express Jazz club.  Earlier in the week, a few pieces from
the duo's new program aired live on the BBC Radio program InTune.<br>

REVIEWS</b><br>
<br>
<b>June 2005 issue, 20th Century Guitar:</b>
<br>
<i>"The ergo is a stunning, high performance fingerstyle guitar......The tonal character [of the ergo] is 'golden'.  The notes, especially noticeable in the trebles, are sweet, round and gorgeous......It is a refined sound, with energy behind it.  With just the right amount of sustain, decay and harmonic overtones..........it is so musical and expressive."</i>
<br><br>
<b>November 2005 Issue, Acoustic Guitar:</b>
<br>
<i>"While he has long been at the forefront of contemporary American lutherie, Fox has surpassed even his own past accomplishments with the forward-thinking design of his new Ergo model."</i>
<br><br>
<b>September 2006 issue, Jazz Improv:</b>
<br>
<i>"Lush, rich, stunning - words that hung in the air when John Etheridge and John Williams met up in the studio with the first ergo to come to Europe.   [John Etheridge says]...."It has the best note separation and tonal balance I have ever heard.  When I'm playing fast runs and arpeggios, the notes are all clearly distinguishable.  You simply cannot outrun this guitar......it's depth and expressive range are remarkable!  It's like I'm playing a grand piano - it's that full and rich. .....[the neck is] very fast and the string spacing is perfect for both fingerstyle work and fast picking.....The wedge-shaped body is just so comfortable.  It feels like you're playing a much smaller guitar.  I can sit and play this guitar for hours."  ......the ergo represents the emerging steel string 'super guitar'.....and it suggests dramatic future developments for the instrument as it evolves in the 21st century."</i>
<br><br>
<b>September 2006 issue, Downbeat:</b>
<br>
<i>"[ with the ergo] Charles Fox has broken new ground in both acoustic guitar design and tonal response....... the ergo is an innovative and exquisitely hand-crafted instrument that plays like a dream and roars like a cannon....... Acoustically, the volume, balance and clarity are amazing....... this is not your average guitar.  Its design, feel and sound place it in a category by itself."</i>
<br><br>
<b>September 2006 issue, Vintage Guitar:</b>
<br>
<i>"The ergo's domed top and tapered body produce tones that are more detailed than those of a typical flat-top........ each note in every chord [is] audibly delineated - single notes, long tones, arpeggios and fast runs all have a strong, immediate attack and  good sustain.  The brace-free lower bout of the top makes the string response very quick, and lightly picked notes and hammer-ons materialize clearly and cleanly.  The notes jump off the guitar.   Played with a plectrum or finger style, the ergo's tone has elements of a good arch top or Selmer-style guitar, but without the bark and startling treble presence that often characterize those models.  This refined, articulate voice makes the ergo a particularly distinctive jazz guitar........ All of this adds up to a guitar that has redefined the acoustic steel-string...... [the ergo is] one of the first notable lutherie achievements of the new millennium."</i>
