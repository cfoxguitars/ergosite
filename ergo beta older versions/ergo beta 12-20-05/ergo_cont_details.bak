There are many components to the voice of a guitar that can sing so directly to our hearts. We commonly mistake the limitations of an instrument itself for the limits of our own musicianship.  It's a revelation then to experience how effortlessly we can play on a true performance quality guitar.<br><br>

		Contact us to discuss the model, options, and custom features that are best for you.  We'll then send you an order confirmation itemizing the details of your instrument and its projected completion date. When you sign and return this order confirmation along with your deposit, your order will be booked and its position in the building schedule secured.<br><br>

		An initial deposit of one-third of the instrument's total cost is required to place your order. A second one-third payment is due when work begins on your guitar, usually 4-5 months before delivery. The final one-third payment is due when your instrument is completed, prior to shipment.<br><br><br><br></td>

		<td align="left" valign="top"><font class="subtitle">Soundboard</font><br><br><font class="body">To achieve the transparent playability that Charles Fox guitars are known for, an uncommon amount of time and attention is lavished on every aspect of the ergo's neck, bridge and overall setup. The ergo's hand-shaped, mirror polished fret work is unsurpassed. Through subtle adjustments of the neck width, string spread, action and other such details each ergo is optimized for its owner's personal playing style.<br><br>
